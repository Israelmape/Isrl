		<h2> BIG DREAM </h2>
		<h4>Become a Doctor and Programmer </h4>
		<p> I have already started taking courses to become a programmer. I used some Youtube courses as well as apps such as Programming Hero and Grasshopper to learn different stuff about programming. For Medicine, I've been accepted to study Medicine at the University of Zambia in 2022. The Medical course will take seven years and so i will just have to concerntrate for seven years in order for me to become a Doctor.As for now, I will concerntrate on developing my programming skills.</p>
